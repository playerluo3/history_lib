                <h1>Spring and Autumn Period</h1>
                <p>The Spring and Autumn Period (770 BC-476 BC / 403 BC), referred to as the Spring and Autumn Period , is the first half of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. The Zhou clan's power was greatly reduced after the relocation of Ping Wangdong, and there was not enough prestige to command the princes, which formed the situation in the early Spring and Autumn Period. In the Spring and Autumn Period, the power of the Emperor Zhou was weakened, the heroes quarreled, and the Spring and Autumn Period hegemony formed. Qi Huangong , Song Xianggong , Jin Wengong , Qin Mugong , and Chuzhuang kings successively dominated the hegemony, known as the " Spring and Autumn Five Hegemony " in history . At that time, Qi Huangong put forward the idea of ​​"respecting the Zhou room, destroying the barbarians, prohibiting usurpation and killing, and restraining annexation" (respecting the king to destroy the barbarians), so Zhou Tianzi was still respected on the surface. During the Spring and Autumn Period, it was named after the " Spring and Autumn Period " revised by Confucius . This book describes from Lu implicit public first year (722 years ago) to the Duke history fourteen years (481 years ago), and two hundred forty-two years. For the sake of convenience, post-historians generally start from the first year of Zhou Ping Wang’s first year (770 BC), from the time when the Ping Wang moved east to Luoyi , to the forty-third year (477 BC) or the forty-four year (476 BC) of King Zhou Jing. ) (Some scholars also believe that it should be at the end of Zuo Zhuan (468 BC), Sanjia Miezhi (453 BC), or Sanjia Division Jin(403 years ago)), called the "Spring and Autumn Period". After the Spring and Autumn Period is the Warring States Period . [1] According to historical records, in the 242 years of the Spring and Autumn Period, 36 monarchs were killed by ministers or enemy countries, and 52 princes were destroyed. [2] . There were more than 480 wars of various sizes, and more than 450 times of court appointments and league meetings of princes. The prince of the Lu Kingdom was hired three times and hired four times.</p>
